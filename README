x34 won!

x33 and x32 where written after the contest and use Geir's BASIC vector trick.

Basically, create a C64 PRG file that draws a light blue cross on the screen
with a black background and border in as few bytes as possible. Some terrible
things where done to reduce the size of the binaries, please don't expect
quality code here :)
